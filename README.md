Issue Tracker System (Java Console Project)

This is a small Java console project where I built a basic Issue Tracking System.
It works like a very simple version of a bug tracker, where you can add issues, view them, update them, search for them, and delete them.
All the data is saved in a text file, so the issues stay even after closing the program.

I made this project mainly to practice:

Core Java,OOP concepts,Collections (ArrayList),File handling,CRUD operations,Writing clean, modular code

Features:
Add new issues
View all issues
Update issue details
Search issues by keyword
Delete issues
Saves all issues in issues.txt
Simple menu-based interface

Tech Used:
Java (Core Java)
ArrayList
Scanner / FileWriter
Basic OOP
